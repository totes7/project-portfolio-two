            <h1>WORLD CUP HISTORY</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international
                association football competition contested by the senior men's national 
                teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA),
                the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years
                since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held 
                because of the Second World War. The current champions are France, who won their second 
                title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.</p>
            <hr class="space">
            <p>The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well 
                as the most widely viewed and followed single sporting event in the world. The cumulative 
                viewership of all matches of the 2006 World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an 
                estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population 
                of the planet.</p> 
            <hr class="space">
            <p> 17 countries have hosted the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, and Mexico have each 
                hosted twice, while Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, 
                Japan and South Korea (jointly), South Africa, and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar will host 
                the 2022 tournament, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which 
                will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three World Cups.

            <h1>TROPHY HISTORY</h1>
            <hr class="space">
            <p>From 1930 to 1970, the Jules Rimet Trophy was awarded 
                to the World Cup winning team. It was originally simply 
                known as the World Cup or Coupe du Monde, but in 1946 it 
                was renamed after the FIFA president Jules Rimet who set 
                up the first tournament. In 1970, Brazil's third victory 
                in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently.
                 However, the trophy was stolen in 1983 and has never been 
                 recovered, apparently melted down by the thieves.
            </p>
            <hr class="space">
            <p>After 1970, a new trophy, known as the FIFA World Cup Trophy, 
                was designed. The experts of FIFA, coming from seven countries, 
                evaluated the 53 presented models, finally opting for the work 
                of the Italian designer Silvio Gazzaniga. The new trophy is 
                36cm (14.2in) high, made of solid 18 carat (75%) gold and weighs 
                6.175 kg (13.6 lb). The base contains two layers of semi-precious 
                malachite while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved 
                year and name of each FIFA World Cup winner since 1974.
